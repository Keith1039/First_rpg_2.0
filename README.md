# First_rpg_2.0
I made a mistake on my last repository so I made a new one with the same files

This is my first attempt at an rpg using Python and as such it is lacking in graphics. Even so, for a first attempt I'm happy with what I've done so far.
Hopefully by the end of this summer I'll be able to release a new updated version with graphics as I learn Pygame. Hope you enjoy.
